# General Eccentric Binary Pulsars

This small project reproduces and extends results from the paper : 
**Bagchi, Lorimer & Wolfe (2018) — "On the detectability of eccentric binary pulsars" ([arXiv:1302.4914](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4914))**. 

The main focus is to model the **line-of-sight velocity and acceleration** of a pulsar in an eccentric binary orbit and investigate how orbital motion affects pulsar detectability in radio surveys.

##  Project Goals
- Implement orbital geometry of binary pulsars, including:
  - Kepler’s equation (mean anomaly → eccentric anomaly → true anomaly).
  - Line-of-sight velocity \(v_l(t)\) and acceleration \(a_l(f)\).
- Reproduce **Figure 2** (velocity vs. time) and **Figure 3** (acceleration vs. true anomaly) from Bagchi et al. (2018).


##  Methods
- **Kepler’s equation solver**: Newton–Raphson iteration with robust initial guesses.
- **Velocity (Eq. 24)** and **Acceleration (Eq. 26)** from Bagchi et al. (2018)
- Parameters configurable: Pulsar mass, companion mass, orbital period, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of periastron (varpi).
- Fully implemented in C++ to generate final CSV data files 
- Used python to plot the data generated by our program.
