# Binary Pulsars – Kepler Equation Solver

This project implements a **C++ solver for Kepler’s equation** to study binary pulsar orbital dynamics.  
It reproduces figures from research papers by generating CSV data (radial velocity, acceleration, etc.), which can be further analyzed and plotted using Python.
